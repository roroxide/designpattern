Design Pattern Principles :

+ Encapsulate what varies.
+ Favor composition over inheritance.
+ Program to interfaces, not implementations.
+ Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
+ Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
+ Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

Dependency Inversion Principles :

+ No variable should hold a reference to a concrete class.
+ No class should derive from a concrete class.
+ No method should override an implemented method of any of its base classes.
